1. Browser Vs Node.js?
=> Browser provide interactin with DOM, or other web platform API like cookies. We don't have Document, cookies, windows and some other Object in Node.js.
=> Node.js provide all the nice API to interactin with File system by Node.js module.

2. Local Module..
=> In Node.js each file is a module that is isolated dy default.
=> To lode a module another functions we use require functions.
=> When index.js file is executed. Then module code is also executed.
=> If the file we are requiring  is a JavaScript. we can skip the file extention name and Node.js is add the file extention on the behalf.
